# Memorize

Assignment that is part of Stanford's CS193p course.

## Description
Memorize is a simple card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. 
The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

## How did I extend the assignment?
- Added formal concepts of "Themes" for the cards with 6 different themes with varying # of cards each new game
- Added business logic for scoring correct matches and incorrect matches based on whether user has already seen a card
- Implemented shuffling button during game with SF Symbols
- Added colorful gradients to themes along with animations for new games and shuffling
